# pdsProject

Project 1 for Parallel and Distributed Systems in A.U.Th.

The report is the "report.pdf" file contained here.

Build any of the files by going to the appropriate directory and running `make`.

To build the OpenCilk version edit the makefile to point to the location of clang++ in your system.

- A possible problem is clang++ being unable to locate the c++ standard library. This is solved by: [Clang++: fatal error: 'iostream' file not found - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54521402/locating-iostream-in-clang-fatal-error-iostream-file-not-found)

stdc++20 is required, but this is trivial to change. If you need this to change please contact me at
isidtsao@ece.auth.gr

Run with the command `./colorSCC` to see the usage information.

The report uploaded here has updated and more accurate measurements. Some benchmarking was done after the deadline due to no longer needing the computer to write the report.

Have fun testing!
