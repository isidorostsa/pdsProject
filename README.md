# pdsProject
Project 1 for Parallel and Distributed Systems in A.U.Th. 

The report is the "report.pdf" file contained here.

Build any of the files by going to the appropriate directory and running `make`

To build the OpenCilk version edit the makefile to point to the location of clang++ in your system.

stdc++20 is required, but in case we need to change that it is trivial, please contact me at 
isidtsao@ece.auth.gr

Run with the command `./colorSCC` to see the usage information.

Have fun testing!
